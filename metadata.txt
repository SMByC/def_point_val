It use Planet Labs month mosiacs RGB 4.77m/pix tiles as imput data for validation. The aim is to reduce fake positves and omision erroros in early deforestation alarms. This tool innovates deforestation detection techniques by using image patterns like textures in place of espectral signatures as explicative variables.
